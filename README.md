# Intro To Java Notes
10-15-2018 first Java project.

## File details
Name.jva = printing strings
int_datatype.java = integers and printing
DataTypesB.java = Boolean operations
DataTypesC.java - char
variables.java

### Char
- The char data type is used to represent single characters. 
- All char values must be enclosed in single quotes, like this: 'G'.


### Variables
- In Java, all variables must have a specified data type.
- A semicolon ; is also used to end all Java single code statements. 
int myLuckyNumber = 7;


### Whitespace
- Whitespace is one or more characters (such as a space, tab, enter, or return) that do not produce a visible mark or text. 
- Whitespace is often used to make code visually presentable.
- Java will ignore whitespace in code, but it is important to know how to use whitespace to structure code well. 

### Comment
```
// I'm a single line comment!
```

```
/*

Hello, 
Java! 

*/
```
### Math
```
int sum = 34 + 113;
int difference = 91 - 205;
int product = 2 * 8; 
int quotient = 45 / 3;
```

### Modulo
- The modulo operator - represented in Java by the % symbol 
- returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.
For example, 15 % 6 will return the value of 3, because that is the remainder left over after dividing 15 by 6.

### Relational operators 
- -  always return a boolean value of true or false.
- < : less than.
- <=: less than or equal to.
- >: greater than.
- >=: greater than or equal to.

### Equality Operators
- ==: equal to.
- !=: not equal to.
